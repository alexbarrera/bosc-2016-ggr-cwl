BOSC abstracts must fit on one page (8.5 inches by 11 inches or A4) and should be
submitted as a PDF (preferred), text or Microsoft Word file. This template will
help you produce a nice PDF after writing your abstract with [Markdown][3] and
converting with [Pandoc][4] and [LaTeX][5].

After replacing this text with your abstract, use the simple
Makefile to build the PDF. Edit the Makefile to match whatever
you named this file, then simply type:

    make

The abstracts will be printed "as is" in the program booklet; having a nice
pre-formatted PDF will help your all-volunteer Organizing Committee.

To be considered for acceptance, software systems representing the central topic
in a presentation submitted to BOSC must be licensed with a recognized Open
Source License, and be freely available for download in source code form.  You
can include images in your abstract if you wish (as long as they fit on the
single page).

We look forward to reading your abstract! Please submit by April 3, 2015.
